  + PerfFuzz: Automatically Generate Pathological Inputs for C/C++ programs : Performance problems in software can arise unexpectedly when programs are provided with inputs that exhibit pathological behavior. But how can we find these inputs in the first place? PerfFuzz can generate such inputs automatically: given a program and at least one seed input, PerfFuzz automatically generates inputs that exercise pathological behavior across program locations, without any domain knowledge.PerfFuzz uses multi-dimensional performance feedback and independently maximizes execution counts for all program locations. This enables PerfFuzz to find a variety of inputs that exercise distinct hot spots in a program. (http://www.carolemieux.com/perffuzz-issta2018.pdf)

- [Savior](https://github.com/evanmak/savior-source) Maintained by [@yaohway](https://github.com/evanmak)
  + SAVIOR, a new hybrid testing framework pioneering a bug-driven principle. Unlike the existing hybrid testing tools, SAVIOR prioritizes the concolic execution of the seeds that are likely to uncover more vulnerabilities. Moreover, SAVIOR verifies all vulnerable program locations along the executing program path. By modeling faulty situations using SMT constraints, SAVIOR reasons the feasibility of vulnerabilities and generates concrete test cases as proofs. Our evaluation shows that the bug-driven approach outperforms mainstream automated testing techniques, including state-of-the-art hybrid testing systems driven by code coverage.

- [T-Fuzz](https://github.com/HexHive/T-Fuzz) Maintained by [@HexHive](https://github.com/HexHive)
  + To improve coverage, existing approaches rely on imprecise heuristics or complex input mutation techniques (e.g., symbolic
execution or taint analysis) to bypass sanity checks. Our novel method tackles coverage from a different angle: by removing sanity checks in the target program. T-Fuzz leverages a coverage guided fuzzer to generate inputs. Whenever the fuzzer can
no longer trigger new code paths, a light-weight, dynamic tracing based technique detects the input checks that the fuzzergenerated inputs fail. These checks are then removed from the target program. Fuzzing then continues on the transformed
program, allowing the code protected by the removed checks to be triggered and potential bugs discovered.
Fuzzing transformed programs to find bugs poses two challenges: (1) removal of checks leads to over-approximation andfalse positives, and (2) even for true bugs, the crashing input on the transformed program may not trigger the bug in the original program. As an auxiliary post-processing step, T-Fuzz leverages a symbolic execution-based approach to filter out false positives and reproduce true bugs in the original program.

- [Parmesan](https://github.com/vusec/parmesan) Maintained by [Sebastian Ãsterlund](https://github.com/sirmc) of [VUSEC](https://github.com/vusec)
  + ParmeSan is a sanitizer-guided greybox fuzzer based on Angora. we present sanitizer-guided fuzzing, a new design point in this space that specifically optimizes for bug coverage. For this purpose, we make the key observation that while the instrumentation performed by existing software sanitizers are regularly used for detecting fuzzer-induced error conditions, they can further serve as a generic and effective mechanism to identify interesting basic blocks for guiding fuzzers. We present the design and implementation of ParmeSan, a new sanitizer-guided fuzzer that builds on this observation. We show that ParmeSan greatly reduces the TTE of real-world bugs, and finds bugs 37% faster than existing state-of-the-art coverage-based fuzzers (Angora) and 288% faster than directed fuzzers (AFLGo), while still covering the same set of bugs.

- [Weizz-Fuzzer](https://github.com/andreafioraldi/weizz-fuzzer) by [Andrea Fioraldi](https://github.com/andreafioraldi)
  + Fuzzing technologies have evolved at a fast pace in recent years, revealing bugs in programs with ever increasing depth and speed. Applications working with complex formats are however more difficult to take on, as inputs need to meet certain format-specific characteristics to get through the initial parsing stage and reach deeper behaviors of the program. Unlike prior proposals based on manually written format specifications, we propose a technique to automatically generate and mutate inputs for unknown chunk-based binary formats. We identify dependencies between input bytes and comparison instructions, and use them to assign tags that characterize the processing logic of the program. Tags become the building block for structure-aware mutations involving chunks and fields of the input. Our technique can perform comparably to structure-aware fuzzing proposals that require human assistance. Our prototype implementation Weizz revealed 16 unknown bugs in widely used programs.

- [Intriguer](https://github.com/seclab-yonsei/intriguer) by [Seclab@Yonsei University](https://github.com/seclab-yonsei)
  + Hybrid fuzzing, which combines fuzzing and concolic execution, is promising in light of the recent performance improvements in concolic engines. We have observed that there is room for further improvement: symbolic emulation is still slow, unnecessary constraints dominate solving time, resources are overly allocated, and hard-to-trigger bugs are missed. To address these problems, we present a new hybrid fuzzer named Intriguer. The key idea of Intriguer is field-level constraint solving, which optimizes symbolic execution with field-level knowledge. Intriguer performs instruction-level taint analysis and records execution traces without data transfer instructions like mov. Intriguer then reduces the execution traces for tainted instructions that accessed a wide range of input bytes, and infers input fields to build field transition trees. With these optimizations, Intriguer can efficiently perform symbolic emulation for more relevant instructions and invoke a solver for complicated constraints only. Our evaluation results indicate that Intriguer outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers: Intriguer found all the bugs in the LAVAM(5h) benchmark dataset for ground truth performance, and also discovered 43 new security bugs in seven real-world programs. We reported the bugs and received 23 new CVEs. [Intriguer: Field-Level Constraint Solving for Hybrid Fuzzing](https://wcventure.github.io/FuzzingPaper/Paper/CCS19_Intriguer.pdf)

  + In this paper, we present DeepFuzzer, an enhanced greybox fuzzer with qualiï¬ed seed generation, balanced seed selection, and hybrid seed mutation. First, we use symbolic execution in a lightweight approach to generate qualiï¬ed initial seeds which then guide the fuzzer through complex checks. Second, we apply a statistical seed selection algorithm to balance the mutation frequency between different seeds. Further, we develop a hybrid mutation strategy. The random and restricted mutation strategies are combined to maintain a dynamic balance between global exploration and deep search .

- [MEUZZ](https://github.com/RiS3-Lab/muse) by [RiS3 Lab Of Northeastern University](https://github.com/RiS3-Lab)
  + Seed scheduling is a prominent factor in determining the yields of hybrid fuzzing. Existing hybrid fuzzers schedule seeds based on fixed heuristics that aim to predict input utilities. However, such heuristics are not generalizable as there exists no one-size-fits-all rule applicable to different programs. They may work well on the programs from which they were derived, but not others. To overcome this problem, we design a Machine learning-Enhanced hybrid fUZZing system (MEUZZ), which employs supervised machine learning for adaptive and generalizable seed scheduling. MEUZZ determines which new seeds are expected to produce better fuzzing yields based on the knowledge learned from past seed scheduling decisions made on the same or similar programs. MEUZZ's learning is based on a series of features extracted via code reachability and dynamic analysis, which incurs negligible runtime overhead (in microseconds). Moreover, MEUZZ automatically infers the data labels by evaluating the fuzzing performance of each selected seed.

  + Symbolic execution is a powerful technique for software analysis and bug detection. Compilation-based symbolic execution is a recently proposed flavor that has been shown to improve the performance of symbolic execution significantly when source code is available. We demonstrate a novel technique to enable compilation-based symbolic execution of binaries (i.e., without the need for source code). Our system, SymQEMU, builds on top of QEMU, modifying the intermediate representation of the target program before translating it to the host architecture. This enables SymQEMU to compile symbolic-execution capabilities into binaries and reap the associated performance benefits while maintaining architecture independence. We present our approach and implementation, and we show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art binary symbolic executors S2E and QSYM with statistical significance; on some benchmarks, it even achieves better performance than the source-based SymCC. Moreover, our tool has found a previously unknown vulnerability in the well-tested libarchive library, demonstrating its utility in testing real-world software.

- [uAFL - Typestate-Guided Fuzzer for Discovering Use-after-Free Vulnerabilities ](https://yuleisui.github.io/publications/icse20.pdf) 
  + Existing coverage-based fuzzers usually use the individual control flow graph (CFG) edge coverage to guide the fuzzing process, which has shown great potential in finding vulnerabilities. However, CFG edge coverage is not effective in discovering vulnerabilities such as use-after-free (UaF). This is because, to trigger UaF vulnerabilities, one needs not only to cover individual edges, but also to traverse some (long) sequence of edges in a particular order, which is challenging for existing fuzzers. To this end, we propose to model UaF vulnerabilities as typestate properties, and develop a typestateguided fuzzer, named UAFL, for discovering vulnerabilities violating typestate properties. Given a typestate property, we first perform a static typestate analysis to find operation sequences potentially violating the property. Our fuzzing process is then guided by the operation sequences in order to progressively generate test cases triggering property violations. In addition, we also employ an information flow analysis to improve the efficiency of the fuzzing process. We have performed a thorough evaluation of UAFL on 14 widely-used real-world programs. The experiment results show that UAFL substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art fuzzers, including AFL, AFLFast, FairFuzz, MOpt, Angora and QSYM, in terms of the time taken to discover vulnerabilities. We have discovered 10 previously unknown vulnerabilities, and received 5 new CVEs.

  In this paper, we propose two solutions to address the challenges Windows fuzzing faces. Our system, WINNIE, first tries to synthesize a harness for the application, a simple program that directly invokes target functions, based on sample executions. It then tests the harness, instead of the original complicated program, using an efficient implementation of fork on Windows. Using these techniques, WINNIE can bypass irrelevant GUI code to test logic deep within the application. We used WINNIE to fuzz 59 closed-source Windows binaries, and it successfully generated valid fuzzing harnesses for all of them. In our evaluation, WINNIE can support 2.2x more programs than existing Windows fuzzers could, and identified 3.9x more program states and achieved 26.6x faster execution. In total, WINNIE found 61 unique bugs in 32 Windows binaries.

  + [Towards Systematic and Dynamic Task Allocation for Collaborative Parallel Fuzzing](https://thuanpv.github.io/publications/AFLTeam-ASE21-NIER.pdf) Parallel coverage-guided greybox fuzzing is the most common setup for vulnerability discovery at scale. However, so far it has received little attention from the research community compared to single-mode fuzzing, leaving open several problems particularly in its task allocation strategies. Current approaches focus on managing micro tasks, at the seed input level, and their task division algorithms are either ad-hoc or static. In our framework, we leverage research on graph partitioning and search algorithms to propose a systematic and dynamic task allocation solution that works at the macro-task level. First, we design an attributed graph to capture both the program structures (e.g., program call graph) and fuzzing information (e.g., branch coverage). Second, our graph partitioning algorithm divides the global program search space into sub-search-spaces. Finally our search algorithm prioritizes these sub-search-spaces (i.e., tasks) and explores them to maximize code coverage and number of bugs found.

- [Registered Report: Dissecting American Fuzzy Lop - A FuzzBench Evaluation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358931321_Registered_Report_Dissecting_American_Fuzzy_Lop_-_A_FuzzBench_Evaluation)
  + AFL is one of the most used and extended fuzzing projects, adopted by industry and academic researchers alike. While the community agrees on AFL's effectiveness at discovering new vulnerabilities and at its outstanding usability, many of its internal design choices remain untested to date. Security practitioners often clone the project "as-is" and use it as a starting point to develop new techniques, usually taking everything under the hood for granted. Instead, we believe that a careful analysis of the different parameters could help modern fuzzers to improve their performance and explain how each choice can affect the outcome of security testing, either negatively or positively. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the internal mechanisms of AFL by performing experiments and comparing different metrics used to evaluate fuzzers. This will prove the efficacy of some patterns and clarify which aspects are instead outdated. To achieve this, we set up nine unique experiments that we carried out on the popular Fuzzbench platform. Each test focuses on a different aspect of AFL, ranging from its mutation approach to the feedback encoding scheme and the scheduling methodologies. Our preliminary findings show that each design choice affects different factors of AFL. While some of these are positively correlated with the number of detected bugs or the target coverage, other features are related to usability and reliability. Most important, the outcome of our experiments will indicate which parts of AFL we should preserve in modern fuzzers.

  + [Mu2](https://github.com/cmu-pasta/mu2) is a greybox fuzznig procedure that agugments the code coverage feedback to save new inputs if they increase the mutation scrore across all previously generated inputs.

  + Recent advances in fuzz testing have introduced
several forms of feedback mechanisms, motivated by the
fact that for a large range of programs and libraries, edgecoverage alone is insufficient to reveal complicated bugs. Inspired by this line of research, we examined existing program representations looking for a match between expressiveness of the structure and adaptability to the context of fuzz testing. In particular, we believe that data dependency graphs (DDGs) represent a good candidate for this task, as the set of information embedded by this data structure is potentially useful to find vulnerable constructs by stressing combinations of def-use pairs that would be difficult for a traditional fuzzer to trigger. Since some portions of the dependency graph overlap with the control flow of the program, it is possible to reduce the additional instrumentation to cover only âinterestingâ data-flow dependencies, those that help the fuzzer to visit the code in a distinct way compared to standard methodologies.

](https://twitter.com/vegard_no)
  + American Fuzzy Lop is a great tool. It does take a little bit of extra setup and tweaking if you want to go into advanced usage, but mostly it just works out of the box. In this post, Iâll detail some of the steps you need to get started with fuzzing the OpenSSH daemon (sshd) and show you some tricks that will help get results more quickly. The AFL home page already displays 4 OpenSSH bugs in its trophy case; these were found by Hanno BÃ¶ck who used an approach similar to that outlined by Jonathan Foote on how to fuzz servers with AFL.
I take a slightly different approach, which I think is simpler: instead of intercepting system calls to fake network activity, we just run the daemon in âinetd modeâ. The inet daemon is not used very much anymore on modern Linux distributions, but the short story is that it sets up the listening network socket for you and launches a new process to handle each new incoming connection. inetd then passes the network socket to the target program as stdin/stdout. Thus, when sshd is started in inet mode, it communicates with a single client over stdin/stdout, which is exactly what we need for AFL.
